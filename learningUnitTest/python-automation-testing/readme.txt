Why do we need to automate?

 - Decreased cost and time of testing
 - Enable continuous delivery through round-the-clock testing
 - Ensure regression testing
 - Increased test coverage

Top layer: User interface tests
Middle layer: Service/API layer tests
Bottom layer: Unit tests
 - numerous, maximum coverage
 - finds bugs down to the line it has occurred
